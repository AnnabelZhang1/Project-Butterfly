# Project-Butterfly

Made as a project for Animal Behavior class on the studies of butterfly food sourcing.

* Hypothesis: Butterflies will be more attracted to flowers that are closer to it and are brightly colored (and therefore sweeter).

Rules:
- White cabbage butterfly - remembers “rewarding” colors and species of flowers; visits less sweet flowers less and less per visit
- Blue morpho butterfly - cares more about flower sweetness than colors
- Clipper butterfly - strong preference for red flowers, next sweetness
- Skipper butterfly - strong preference for flowers that are clustered near each other and closer to the butterfly overall than sweetness


Made with Kaley Hu.
